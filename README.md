# MyNode documentation

Community-built documentation for [MyNode](https://mynodebtc.com/) - a neat way to run a Bitcoin and Lightning node, and many more related applications.

This repo uses [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) to compile markdown files into a full documentation website.

## Build the documentation locally

1. Install dependencies: Node.js 10+, and Yarn
  - [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  - [Install Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
2. Run the following commands:
```sh
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode_docs.git
# Install required node modules
yarn install
# serve locally (by default on port 8080)
yarn docs:dev
```
## How to contribute?

For the first version of documentation (due on September 30th), read the [plan](https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode_docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3APlan) and comment on a suitable section-related issue from this list: [Milestone 1](https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode_docs/milestone/1). Follow the file structure (mentioned below) and follow the usual protocol to submit pull requests (also mentioned below under "Major Changes"). You should create draft PRs as soon as possible to show your progress and avoid any overlaps with others.

If you have never used Github, don't worry. Read this [awesome article](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) to get started and comment on a suitable issue to seek guidance.

### File structure

- All the pages are written in markdown and located in [docs](https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode_docs/tree/master/docs)
- Create an appropriate subdirectory to collect pages for the same app or section of documentation
- Upload images (preferably PNG) in the matching subdirectory of [/docs/.vuepress/public/images](https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode_docs/tree/master/docs/.vuepress/public/images)
- Add images to markdown pages using either
  - HTML: `<img>` tag with `src="/images/<SUBDIRECTORY>/<FILENAME>"`
  - Markdown: `![<ALT-TEXT>](/images/<SUBDIRECTORY>/<FILENAME>)`
- Add links to the created pages on the navbar and/or sidebar by editing [docs/.vuepress/config.js](https://github.com/mynodebtc/mynode_docs/blob/master/docs/.vuepress/config.js). Read this [VuePress guide](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/theme/default-theme-config.html) to learn more.
