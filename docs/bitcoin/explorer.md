# Explorer

## Overview
Blockchain explorers are GUI applications built over the Bitcoin blockchain to see transactions and public addresses. Generally, mobile and hardware wallets use trusted third-party explorers to check wallet balances and confirm transactions which leaks the private details (like IP address, bitcoin balance). Instead, having a local explorer with personal Bitcoin node will improve privacy and remove the trust on third-party explorers.

The myNode explorer requires the [Electrum server](/electrum/electrum), so the user must enable their Electrum server and then wait for the server to sync completely before they can use the explorer. [MempoolSpace](/bitcoin/mempool) is an alternative explorer which doesn't have any dependency.
