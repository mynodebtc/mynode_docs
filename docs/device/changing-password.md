# Changing your Password

After setting up your myNode, it is important to change the password. When performing various actions on your device, you will be prompted to enter you password before accessing sensitive data. Setting your own password will secure your device.

First, go to the settings page. Next, fill out your current password. If it has never been set, the default password is "bolt".
