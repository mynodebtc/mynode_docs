A GUI to manage Lightning channels

## Introduction

Created by Anthony Potdevin, ThunderHub is an open-source LND node manager to monitor your node and manage channels via a web-interface. It allows you to take control of the Lightning network with a simple and intuitive UX.

## ThunderHub on myNode

ThunderHub is already configured with default environment variables and connected to the Lightning wallet, but it is disabled by default. To enable it, open the myNode homepage and find the tile with the ThunderHub logo under Beta Apps (like the left image below).

Click on the **Enable** button, and wait for the page to refresh.

You should now see a **ThunderHub** button (like shown on the right image above) and a green dot. On clicking this button, a new tab should open on your browser, containing ThunderHub.

On the ThunderHub tab, click the **Login** button, enter your myNode password and then click on **Connect**.
